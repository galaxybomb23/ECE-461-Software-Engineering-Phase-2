# ECE 461 Project

## Description
This project implements a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for ACME Corporation to assess the re-usability and trustworthiness of open-source npm modules, particularly those hosted on GitHub. The tool evaluates various metrics, such as ramp-up time, correctness, security risks, license compatibility, and responsiveness, to help developers make informed decisions when considering the re-use of software packages.

The CLI interacts with the GitHub API and performs local static and dynamic analysis on cloned repositories. It also provides modularity to allow the addition of new metrics as needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning repositories)
- A **GitHub API Token** (used for API access)

### Steps
1. Clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Miller11k/ECE-461.git
    ```

2. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Setup .env
    ```bash
    GITHUB_TOKEN=[Your Github TOekn]
    LOG_LEVEL=0
    LOG_FILE=log.log
    ```

## Usage
The CLI is designed to analyze npm modules by interacting with GitHub repositories and running metric evaluations. To run the tool, use the following command:

```bash
./run test
```

Example:
```bash
npm ./run __tests__/data/sample_urls.txt
```

## Configuration
The CLI requires a GitHub token for API access. To configure this:

1. Obtain a GitHub personal access token by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
2. Set the token in your .env file:
